This app consists of a calculator, I took the inspiration and style from the calculator on my cell phone.
To develop a calculator with react.js I used useState, I start by defining the input that starts with useState 0, then I define the numbers, each key will reflect the number defined in the input. After having this defined, I configure the mathematical operations taking into account that the first number that is entered after the user clicks on an operator, this number is stored and is replaced by a second number. The operator that is clicked will define the result of the operation between these two numbers, which must be reflected in the input.
